Searching partners with relations
---------------------------------

Searching for relations is integrated transparently into the partner search
form. To find all assistants in your database, fill in 'is assistant of' and
autocomplete will propose to search for partners having this relation. Now if
you want to find Anna's assistant, you fill in 'Anna' and one of the proposals
is to search for partners having a relation with Anna. This results in Anna's
assistant(s), as you searched for assistants before.

By default, only active, not expired relations are shown. If you need to find
partners that had some relation at a certain date, fill in that date in the
search box and one of the proposals is to search for relations valid at that
date.
